## About the Project

This project is a **versatile playlist and top creator**, designed to help you organize and explore your interests however you like. If the easy organization of platforms like Rate Your Music, Letterboxd, or Goodreads sounds familiar, you've come to the right place! This ranking and list creation system is **inspired by the clarity and effectiveness of those sites**.

What's unique about this tool is that **much of its JavaScript code was generated by artificial intelligence**. It's a personal experiment to showcase the potential of AI in web development and how it can help us build functional solutions in innovative ways.

To add your data and create your tops, you have two options: you can do it **manually** within the interface, or if you prefer to work with larger volumes of information, you can **import and export your lists and data in XLSX (spreadsheet) format**. This gives you flexibility in managing your content.

I want to be very clear: **this project does not seek to compete with or replace your favorite platforms**. This is an independent initiative, intended as a complementary tool and a demonstration of what can be achieved with current technologies. I hope you enjoy creating your own tops!
